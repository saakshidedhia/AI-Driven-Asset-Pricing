# AI-Driven Asset Pricing

This repository contains the research and implementation for the project **"AI Driven Asset Pricing: The Impact of ChatGPT and AI Announcements on Tech Stocks (ETFs)"**.  
It explores how sentiment around AI-related announcements, especially those involving ChatGPT, affects the short-term returns of technology-sector ETFs.

## üìä Visualizations

### ETF Returns vs Sentiment
![ETF vs Sentiment](/SRC/1-ETFpricevsSentimentScores.png)  
*ETF price changes closely tracked sentiment scores during event windows.*

---

### OLS Regression Results
![OLS Regression](/SRC/2-OLSRegressionResult.png)  
*OLS regression shows a positive and significant relationship between sentiment scores and 3-day CAR.*

---

### Overall Visualization
![Overall Visualization](/SRC/3-OverallVisualization.png)  
*Scatter plot of sentiment vs CAR and distribution of CAR values across the sample.*

---

### ACF and PACF Analysis
![ACF PACF](/SRC/4-CAR'sACFandPACF.png)  
*ACF and PACF plots helped determine ARIMAX model parameters.*

---

### ARIMAX(1,0,0) Results
![ARIMAX(1,0,0)](/SRC/5-ARIMAXRegressionResult.png)  
*ARIMAX(1,0,0) confirms significance of sentiment and market factors in explaining CAR.*

---

### ARIMAX(0,0,0) Results
![ARIMAX(0,0,0)](/SRC/6-ARIMAX_RegressionResult.png)  
*ARIMAX(0,0,0), essentially an OLS with exogenous factors, yields similar significance patterns.*

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `arch` (for GARCH models)
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`
